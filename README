## Project documentation and conventions ##

Directory structure:
 lib/           Library code. Functions, classes, algorithms, ...
 templates/     HTML templates and related code
 styles/        Stylesheets
 scripts/       Javascript code
 images/        Image files, if any
 ./             Main script files

Special files:
 init.php       The script which pulls in the rest of the code. Typically, include this one first in your code.
 config.php     Project configuration. Defines all global variables. Is included from init.php
 index.php      The script which is executed by default if no file is specified in the URL. Points to one of the main pages.

## Code style guide ##

We follow the ZEND code styleguide by default:
  http://framework.zend.com/manual/1.12/en/coding-standard.coding-style.html

or, more extensively defined, the FIG standard:
  http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/

Some additional naming definitions:
* Variables:

  We use camelCase for variable names:
   $numberOfResults
   $nameAndAddress

  Variable names have to have at least 3 characters, with the exception of common counter variables ($i, $j)

  Global variables (and only those) are all uppercase:
   $DB_HOST

* Functions:

  Start with a lowercase letter:
   function calculateSomething() {}
  
  Templates start with t_
   function t_startHeader() {}

  Private functions (which should not be used outside the file defining them) start with an underscore
   function _t_internal_method() {}

* Classes:

  Start with an uppercase letter:
   class Foo;
   class SqlResultHandler;
