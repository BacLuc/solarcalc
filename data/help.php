    'sunhours'   => '<h4>Suntime</h4> This value describes the average amount of 100\% sun ligth per day. This value is usually a lot smaller than the total time between sunrise and sunset. This is because early in the morning and late in the evening the sun might still be shining, but not as stron as at midday. Therefore less power is generated at such time. The suntime is a local value that should be checked with a climat service.',
    'amount'     => '<h4>Amount</h4> This value describes how many units of this load you will use in your installation.',
    'daytime'    => '<h4>Day time</h4> This value describes how long the device is used when the sun is still shining strong. This value can not be larger than the <em>Suntime</em> that is defined at the top of the page. If this value is chosen to be larger than <em>Suntime</em>, then the value will be reduced and the over flow will be added to the <em>Night time</em>. This value does not affect the choice of battery, only the choice and number of panels as all power to support the device during the <em>Day time</em> comes from the panel directly.',
    'nighttime'  => '<h4>Night time</h4> This value describes how long the device is used during the night or when the sun is not strong enough. This value contributes to the size of the battery that will be needed to support this installation. This value will also influence the number of panels as the energy stored in the battery has to be generated during the time of sunlight.',
    'autonomy'   => '<h4>Autonomy</h4> This value describes how many days this device should be able to run without any sunlight. This value affects the choice and amount of batteries as well as the panels. For every day of autonomy, the the amount of [Day time] + [Night time] is added to [Nighttime].<br/>For example, if for a LED lamp with day time 2 hours and night  time 5 hours the autonomy is set to 1 day, then the new values will be daytime 2 hours and nighttime  12 hours. The equation is nighttime = nightime + autonomy*(daytime + nighttime) = 5 h + 1*(2h + 5h) = 12h.',
    'sold'       => '<h4>Sold</h4> This value describes if the device(s) are sold in the project. If this field is ticked, then the price of the device(s) will be added to the budget at the end. This field can be unticked, if for example, some devices are already installed or owned by the customer and only the solar panels and battery are sold to the customer.',
    'name'       => '<h4>Name</h4> This is the name of the device that will be used in this project. If in addition the <em>Save</em> field is ticked, the device will be stored in the database with this name.',
    'type'       => '<h4>Type</h4> This value describes if the device is an AC or a DC powered device. If there are any AC devices in the project, then an inverter will be added to the project, automatically.',
    'power'      => '<h4>Power</h4> This value describes how much power the device needs to run. The lower the better. If the total amount of power needed by this projects devices is too large, then it will take longer to calculate the optimal solutions or it might completely fail.',
    'voltage'    => '<h4>Voltage</h4> This value describes how much input voltage the device is needing. If this is any value significantly lower or higher than the standard voltage, 12.5 Volt, then a warning will be given, as a buckboost converter might be needed.',
    'price'      => '<h4>Price</h4> This value describes the price of the device. Be careful to select the correct currency as is depicted with the little symbol to the right.',
    'stock'      => '<h4>Stock</h4> This value describes how many of this device are in stock. This value is especially important if the device is saved to the database. If the number of used devices is above the number of devices in stock, a warning will be given.',
    'save'       => '<h4>Save</h4> If this field is checked, then the data submitted in these forms will be saved to the database as a new load. Use this if you require a new load in your project that has not been added to the database before but will be needed in other projects as well. Do not save unique devices that are only used by one project, as this will jam the database.',
    'product'    => '<h4>Product</h4> This is the load you choose to connect to your solar installation. The more products you choose, the more panels and batteries you will need for the system to run.',
    'description'=> '<h4>Description</h4> This text can be chosen freely to describe the device with more details.',
    'peak_power' => '<h4>Peak Power</h4> This value describes the maximum power a panel can give under the right conditions. This value is usually a bit higher than the general power.',
    'id'         => '<h4>ID</h4> This value is for identification purposes within the program. If any two devices should be given the same name, they can still be distinguished by their identity number.',
    'dod'        => '<h4>Depth of depletion</h4> This value describes how much of the total battery capacity should be used, without harming the battery. The battery should not be depleted further than this value. For acid based batteries, this value is usually around 50\%, for LiFePO4 batteries this value is usually around 80\%. This means that for no more of 50\% of the capacity of the acid battery and no more than 80\% of the capacity of the LiFePO4 battery. If this rule is violated, the lifespan of the battery will reduce significantely.',
    'loss'       => '<h4>Loss</h4> This value describes the loss of energy, during processing. This can affect the charging of the battery, or the conversion and handling in the controller or in an inverter or any other intermediate device. Loss means, that not all of the input energy is converted to the desired goal. For a battery with 10\% charging loss this means that to charge 50Ah, the panel has to deliver 55Ah as 5Ah will be lost in the charging process. Similar calculations can be done for the controller and the other loss affected devices.',
    'discharge'  => '<h4>Discharge</h4> This value describes how much a battery discharges over one year if it is stored with full charge. It is important not to let the charge of a stored battery fall too low, i.e., below the DoD value or the battery lifespan will reduce significantely.',
    'lifespan'   => '<h4>Lifespan</h4> This value describes how long a battery can be used, before its capacity drops below 80\% of its original value. This lifespan is given in terms of full cycles. Every full charge and discharge (with respect to the DoD) counts for one cycle. If a battery has a lifespan of 2000 cycles and is charged and discharged every day, then this battery will last for 2000cy/365d = 5.5 years. After this time, the expected capacity will be below 80\% of the initial capacity.',

    'status'             => '<h4>Status</h4> This value describes the situation of the project. There are a total of four different states: <em>planned</em>, <em>executing</em>,  <em>completed</em> and <em>cancelled</em>. When a project is newly created, it will always have the status <em>planned</em>. In this status, the stock of the chosen loads, panels and batteries will not yet be updated according to the projects usage. The configuration of the project can be be changed arbitrarily. From this value, the status can be changed to <em>executing</em> or <em>cancelled</em>. If the status is changed to executing, then the processed loads, panels and batteries will be subtracted from the current stock. In this status, it is no longer possible to change the configuration details of the project but it is still possible to change the meta data. The project is no longer deletable. To be able to change any of the configuration details or to delete the project, the status has to be set back to <em>planned</em> or <em>cancelled</em> . From the status of <em>executing</em> the transistion to <em>completed</em> is possible. In the status of <em>completed</em> neither the meta data nor the configuration details can be changed. But it is now possible to delete a project. It is possible to go back to the status <em>executing</em> if infomration has to be changed.',
    'material_allowance'  => '<h4>Material allowance</h4> This value describes how much money is spent for working materials such as caples, dominos and others. This value should be chosen to be enough for the whole project.',

    'avg_const_current'  => '<h4>Average constant current</h4> This value describes the maximum current that can be taken from the battery over a long period of time. To calculate the current to be drawn from the battery, sum up all load power demand over the load voltage. E.g. we have a 7 W lamp and a 30 W refrigerator running at the same time. Both have an input voltage of 12.5 Volt. The current, these two devices draw together is 7 W / 12.5 + 30 W / 12.5 = 0.56 A + 2.4 A = 2.96 A. Be careful not to overstep this value as this might harm the battery.',
    'max_humidity'       => '<h4>Maximum humidity</h4> This value describes the maximum humidity of the environment where the battery is running. Measure the humidity at the target place and consider this value. If this value is overstepped, it might harm the battery or reduce its lifetime.',

    'expected_lifetime'  => '<h4>Expected lifetime</h4> This value gives the minimum time before one of the components of the installation is expected to fail. Other parts of the installation might have longer lifetimes and can be used in a new installation. Usually, the limiting factor for the lifetime are the batteries, which have shorter lifetime expectancies than the panels and other devices.',
